System Design Document: Web Application using Apache2, PHP, and JBoss Enterprise Application

Overview:
We are creating a web application that will use Apache2, PHP, and JBoss Enterprise Application. The application will be hosted on a server and accessed through a web browser. Users will be able to access the application, create an account, and perform various tasks within the application.

Architecture:
The web application will be hosted on a server that will have Apache2 installed as the web server. PHP will be used as the scripting language for the web pages. JBoss Enterprise Application will be used to deploy and manage the application's business logic.

The web server will be responsible for handling incoming requests from clients, serving static content, and passing dynamic content requests to the PHP interpreter. The PHP interpreter will process the requests and generate dynamic content, which will be returned to the web server. The web server will then serve the dynamic content to the client.

JBoss Enterprise Application will be used to deploy the application's business logic. The application's code will be packaged as an enterprise archive (EAR) and deployed to JBoss. JBoss will manage the lifecycle of the application, providing services such as connection pooling, transaction management, and security.

Components:
The web application will consist of the following components:

User interface: The user interface will be implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The UI will allow users to interact with the application, create an account, and perform various tasks within the application.

Web server: Apache2 will be used as the web server for the application. The web server will handle incoming requests, serve static content, and pass dynamic content requests to the PHP interpreter.

PHP interpreter: PHP will be used as the scripting language for the web pages. The PHP interpreter will process incoming requests, generate dynamic content, and return it to the web server.

Business logic: The application's business logic will be implemented using Java and packaged as an EAR. JBoss Enterprise Application will be used to deploy and manage the application's business logic.

Database: The application will use a relational database to store data. MySQL or PostgreSQL will be used as the database management system.

Deployment:
The application will be deployed on a server with the following configuration:

Ubuntu or CentOS operating system
Apache2 web server
PHP interpreter
JBoss Enterprise Application
MySQL or PostgreSQL database management system

The application will be accessible through a web browser using a URL provided by the hosting provider.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, we have designed a web application that will be hosted on a server using Apache2, PHP, and JBoss Enterprise Application. The application will consist of a user interface, web server, PHP interpreter, business logic, and database. The application will be deployed on a server with Ubuntu or CentOS operating system, Apache2 web server, PHP interpreter, JBoss Enterprise Application, and MySQL or PostgreSQL database management system.
